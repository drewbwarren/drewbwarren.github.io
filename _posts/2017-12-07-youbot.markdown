description: As a project for a robotic manipulation course, I developed a controller for the Kuka Youbot. From a desired trajectory for the end effector, I calculated the joint angles and base states that will place the end effector in that trajectory. To correct an initial error from the trajectory and to continue through the path, I used a combined feedforward and PI controller.
