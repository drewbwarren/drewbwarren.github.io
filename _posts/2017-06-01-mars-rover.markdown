description: For my senior capstone project at Brigham Young University I was a part of the Mars Rover team. The project involved designing, constructing, programming, and operating a rover to participate in the University Rover Challenge hosted by the Mars Society. I was mainly responsible for design, control and operation of the robot arm, as well as work on the drive system. The BYU rover was a success and our team earned fourth place in the competition against teams from 35 universities from around the world.
