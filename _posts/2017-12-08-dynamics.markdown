description: This project combined all the principles that I gained from a class all about ROS, the Robot Operating System. I worked together on a team with four other students to program a Baxter robot to locate a cup on a table, grasp the cup, locate the right hand of a person in view of a depth sensing camera, and the bring the cup to the person's hand without tipping it over.
