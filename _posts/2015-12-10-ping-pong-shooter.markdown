description: During my undergradute studies, I participated in a mechatronics course project that involved creating a ping pong ball shooter robot for a competition. The robot was placed in the arena, had to collect ping pong balls from a dispenser, identify an active goal (one out of three), and shoot the balls into the goal. All of this was done autonomously. The hardware was built from laser-cut wood and acryllic, off the shelf motors and sensors, and fabricated printed circuit boards. The robot was controlled by a PIC32 microchip and programmed with C. I was personally tasked with converting all of the prototype circuits to more robust PCB's. The robot included an IR sensor with filtering to locate the active gate.
