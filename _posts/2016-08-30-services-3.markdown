This project was for a charity organization called Special Needs for Speed. The charity builds custom bicycles for children who can not ride normal bicycles because of physical disabilities. Our team upgraded a Power Wheels car for a young girl with a severe case of dwarfisn. The upgrade used microcontrollers, motor drivers, and gear trains to make the car faster and able to control by hand.
