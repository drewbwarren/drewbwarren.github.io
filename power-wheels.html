                    This project was for a charity organization called Special Needs for Speed. The charity builds custom bicycles for children who cannot ride normal bicycles because of physical disabilities. Our team upgraded a Power Wheels car for a young girl with a severe case of dwarfism named Juliet. The upgrade used microcontrollers, motor drivers, and gear trains to make the car faster and able to control by hand.

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/155138998">Special Needs For Speed</a> had previously built a bike for Juliet because of her dwarfism. After a year or so, her condition turned out to be more unique and her knees wouldn’t allow her to make the motion to pedal the bike. Juliet still wanted to play out on the streets with her siblings and friends. The charity’s founder, Deveren Farley, had the idea to build her a motorized car, similar to the Power Wheels toys except stronger and faster. He is a welder by trade, so he came to my professor for help with the mechatronic system.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>Four of us students volunteered to work on the project. Deveren came to us, brought with him a “Frozen” themed Power Wheels car, and told us to make it faster and more robust. Two of the students worked on building a strong metal frame to place the body on.</p>

<p>I and the other student were responsible for the electrical system and drive train. I sized a motor for the task and designed the gear ratio needed between the motor and the axle. My teammate and I designed and built a system that would control the motor’s speed for forward and reverse motion. We used an Arduino for the logic because it was inexpensive and our system was not complex enough to need more advanced computers. One of the suggestions given to us by Deveren was to make the car able to control by hand since Juliet had difficulty with her legs. So we designed a dash panel that had all the controls on it: a power switch, a lever for speed control, a switch to control the led ribbon we installed underneath the car, and a battery indicator. We designed the car and the circuit so that it would be easy to charge and switch out batteries when needed.</p>
